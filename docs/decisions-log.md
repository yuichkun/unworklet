## Q1 — Scalar type defaults

**Status:** resolved.
**Decision:** authoritative wording in `00-foundations.md` §4. Summary: numeric literals lift to `Node<'f32'>`; cross-precision conversion is explicit (`f32(node)` / `f64(node)`); operations on mixed-precision operands are a compile-time type error.
**Rationale:** AudioWorklet I/O is `Float32Array`-typed end-to-end; `f32` default avoids per-sample boundary conversions and matches the Web Audio data plane. Audio-rate DSP overwhelmingly uses f32.
**Rejected:**
- *`f64` literal default* — would force per-sample f32↔f64 conversions at every I/O boundary and double linear-memory footprint. Mismatched with the data plane.
- *Mandatory type hints on every literal* (e.g. `add(node, f32(0.4))`) — maximally explicit but verbose enough to harm readability of typical DSP expressions, with no precision benefit over the chosen default.
