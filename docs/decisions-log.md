## Q1 — Scalar type defaults

**Status:** resolved.
**Decision:** authoritative wording in `00-foundations.md` §4. Summary: numeric literals lift to `Node<'f32'>`; cross-precision conversion is explicit (`f32(node)` / `f64(node)`); operations on mixed-precision operands are a compile-time type error.
**Rationale:** AudioWorklet I/O is `Float32Array`-typed end-to-end; `f32` default avoids per-sample boundary conversions and matches the Web Audio data plane. Audio-rate DSP overwhelmingly uses f32.
**Rejected:**
- *`f64` literal default* — would force per-sample f32↔f64 conversions at every I/O boundary and double linear-memory footprint. Mismatched with the data plane.
- *Mandatory type hints on every literal* (e.g. `add(node, f32(0.4))`) — maximally explicit but verbose enough to harm readability of typical DSP expressions, with no precision benefit over the chosen default.

## Q2 — Third-party DSP helper integration layer

**Status:** partial — Q2-a (layer count) resolved; Q2-b (L1 surface) and Q2-c (L2 surface) TBD.
**Decision (Q2-a):** authoritative wording in `01-dsl.md` §5. Summary: two integration layers — L1 (pure TS function, inlined) and L2 (`defineSubgraph`, stateful, inlined into the parent WASM module). No "separate processor + connect" L3 layer — that case is covered by `AudioWorkletNode.connect()` directly and is outside unworklet's API surface.
**Rationale:** L1/L2 inlining means the helper boundary has zero runtime cost, which is the precondition for a healthy third-party ecosystem (filters, oscillators, envelopes, FFT helpers, …) where users can compose freely without worrying about call overhead. The state/no-state split is the cleanest rule for choosing between the two; anything more implicit (auto-promotion, shape inference) blurs graph-capture vs type-inference responsibilities.
**Rejected:**
- *Single unified layer with auto-promotion* — would auto-classify a function as L1 or L2 based on whether its body calls `state.*`. Makes graph capture and type inference jointly responsible for the layer decision; explicit separation isolates the rules.
- *Four+ layers (e.g. "stateful + sub-processor")* — premature for v0.1; the rare case of needing an internal sub-processor can be assembled at the host level by composing two `defineProcessor`s.
- *Wrapping `AudioWorkletNode.connect()` as an L3* — adds API surface for a thing that is already a Web Audio standard. The wrapper would either re-expose the standard verbatim (no value) or paper over its semantics (worse than direct use).
- *User-defined compile-time macros* — deferred. L1/L2 cover the bulk of the third-party use case; macros can be revisited post-v0.1 if a concrete need surfaces.
