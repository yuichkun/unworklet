## Q1 — Scalar type defaults

**Status:** resolved.
**Decision:** authoritative wording in `00-foundations.md` §4. Summary: numeric literals lift to `Node<'f32'>`; cross-precision conversion is explicit (`f32(node)` / `f64(node)`); operations on mixed-precision operands are a compile-time type error.
**Rationale:** AudioWorklet I/O is `Float32Array`-typed end-to-end; `f32` default avoids per-sample boundary conversions and matches the Web Audio data plane. Audio-rate DSP overwhelmingly uses f32.
**Rejected:**
- *`f64` literal default* — would force per-sample f32↔f64 conversions at every I/O boundary and double linear-memory footprint. Mismatched with the data plane.
- *Mandatory type hints on every literal* (e.g. `add(node, f32(0.4))`) — maximally explicit but verbose enough to harm readability of typical DSP expressions, with no precision benefit over the chosen default.

## Q2 — Third-party DSP helper integration layer

**Status:** resolved.

**Decision (Q2-a):** authoritative wording in `01-dsl.md` §5.1–§5.4. Summary: two integration layers — L1 (pure TS function, inlined) and L2 (`defineSubgraph`, stateful, inlined into the parent WASM module). No "separate processor + connect" L3 layer — that case is covered by `AudioWorkletNode.connect()` directly and is outside unworklet's API surface.

**Decision (Q2-b):** authoritative wording in `01-dsl.md` §5.5. Summary:

- L1 helpers are stateless TypeScript functions inlined at the call site, living entirely in expression scope.
- Parameters: `Node<T>`, caller-owned `State<T>` (with `load`/`store`), caller-owned `Param`, and compile-time constants.
- Return: single `Node<T>`, tuples, records, or `void`. Each returned `Node` is an independent graph terminal.
- Precision-generic via TypeScript generics over `'f32' | 'f64'`; Q1's no-implicit-widening still holds inside the body.
- Body forbids new `state.*` / `buffer.*` / `param.*` declarations, `defineSubgraph` declarations, L2 instantiations, and `message` / `event` declarations; allows primitives, `load` / `store` on parameter `State`, `param.at` on parameter `Param`, and calls to other L1 helpers.
- Violations are caught at graph-capture / static-analysis time (compile time, never runtime) and surfaced with refactor-hint error messages. Detailed error-UX policy lives in `03-compiler.md` §2 (Q22).

**Decision (Q2-c):** authoritative wording in `01-dsl.md` §5.6. Summary:

- Subgraph body uses the same two-scope shape as `defineProcessor`: declaration scope at the top, expression scope inside a `process` lambda. Symmetry is intentional — L2 and root processors share one mental model.
- Instantiation syntax is the direct call form `subgraph(args)`, mirroring L1 helpers so consumers can compose subgraphs and L1 helpers interchangeably.
- The `process` lambda's return becomes the subgraph's output and follows the same shapes as L1 helpers (single `Node<T>`, tuple, record, `void`); the instantiation expression's type is inferred from this return.
- Subgraphs may only be instantiated in declaration scope (the body of `defineProcessor` or another `defineSubgraph`, before its `process` lambda) — never inside an expression scope. Conditional output is expressed by instantiating both branches and choosing with `select`.
- Inside the subgraph body: declaration scope allows declarations and L2 instantiations; expression scope (`process` lambda) follows the same rules as L1 bodies.
- Violations are graph-capture / static-analysis errors with refactor-hint messages.

**Rationale (Q2-a):** L1/L2 inlining means the helper boundary has zero runtime cost, which is the precondition for a healthy third-party ecosystem (filters, oscillators, envelopes, FFT helpers, …) where users can compose freely without worrying about call overhead. The state/no-state split is the cleanest rule for choosing between the two; anything more implicit (auto-promotion, shape inference) blurs graph-capture vs type-inference responsibilities.

**Rationale (Q2-b):**

- *Caller-owned `State<T>` parameters*: lets a parent processor own state across multiple call sites (e.g. per-channel) and delegate logic to a single L1 helper without forcing every state-aware helper into L2.
- *Tuple / record returns*: stereo or multi-tap helpers (e.g. an SVF returning low/band/high) are common; capturing each output as an independent terminal incurs no extra cost.
- *Precision-generic helpers*: avoids forcing third-party authors to ship two definitions for f32/f64. TS generics carry no runtime cost and the no-implicit-widening rule still type-checks inside the generic body.
- *Compile-time enforcement of body constraints*: violations are detectable statically from the source position of `state.*` / `defineSubgraph` calls; surfacing them at runtime would either compromise realtime safety (errors on the audio thread) or require silent fallbacks. Refactor-hint error messages turn the constraint into actionable guidance for the helper author.

**Rationale (Q2-c):**

- *Two-scope body symmetric with `defineProcessor`*: a unified mental model for L2 and root processors. Helper authors learn one shape, error messages reference one set of scope rules, and the implementation can share graph-capture machinery between the two.
- *Direct-call instantiation*: keeps consumer-side composition syntax identical between L1 and L2 (`helper(args)` either way). Wrapping in an explicit `.instantiate(...)` would split L1 vs L2 in the consumer's mind without buying any expressiveness.
- *L1-aligned return shapes*: L2 inherits the same multi-output flexibility decided in Q2-b. No reason to constrain L2 outputs more narrowly than L1 returns.
- *Instantiation in declaration scope only*: each instantiation is a declaration of an independent state slot, so it belongs with other declarations. Allowing instantiation in expression scope makes it tempting to read subgraphs as runtime-allocated, blurring the static graph-structure guarantee. Conditional dispatch is already expressible via `select` over multiple pre-instantiated branches.

**Rejected:**

- *Single unified layer with auto-promotion* (Q2-a) — would auto-classify a function as L1 or L2 based on whether its body calls `state.*`. Makes graph capture and type inference jointly responsible for the layer decision; explicit separation isolates the rules.
- *Four+ layers (e.g. "stateful + sub-processor")* (Q2-a) — premature for v0.1; the rare case of needing an internal sub-processor can be assembled at the host level by composing two `defineProcessor`s.
- *Wrapping `AudioWorkletNode.connect()` as an L3* (Q2-a) — adds API surface for a thing that is already a Web Audio standard. The wrapper would either re-expose the standard verbatim (no value) or paper over its semantics (worse than direct use).
- *User-defined compile-time macros* (Q2-a) — deferred. L1/L2 cover the bulk of the third-party use case; macros can be revisited post-v0.1 if a concrete need surfaces.
- *L1 with no `State<T>` parameters allowed* (Q2-b) — would force every state-touching helper into L2, even simple per-channel `smoothFollow`-style functions. Adds boilerplate without isolating any meaningful invariant.
- *L1 with single-`Node<T>` return only* (Q2-b) — would force common multi-output helpers (stereo, SVF, multi-band split) into L2 or split returns, losing readability without performance benefit.
- *Precision-fixed helpers (no generics)* (Q2-b) — would force third-party authors to ship two copies of every helper for f32/f64, structurally lagging f64 ecosystem coverage.
- *Runtime-checked body constraints* (Q2-b) — would either compromise realtime safety (error on the audio thread) or silently fall back; both worse than static rejection.
- *Subgraph body with declaration and expression intermixed in the top scope (no `process` lambda)* (Q2-c) — saves 1–2 lines of boilerplate but breaks the mental-model symmetry with `defineProcessor` and gives error messages no consistent location to point at. The boilerplate cost is trivial compared to the parallel-structure benefit.
- *Explicit `.instantiate(...)` method on subgraphs* (Q2-c) — adds asymmetry between L1 helper calls and L2 instantiations on the consumer side without buying expressiveness.
- *Subgraph instantiation allowed in expression scope* (Q2-c) — makes graph structure dependent on what a `process` lambda chose to call, breaking the "instance count is statically known" guarantee. Conditional dispatch is already cleanly expressible via `select` over pre-instantiated branches.

## Q3 — SIMD scope for v0.1

**Status:** resolved.

**Decision:** authoritative wording in `00-foundations.md` §4 (vector types) and `01-dsl.md` §7 (opt-in SIMD surface). Summary:

- **Q3-a (opt-in & namespaced):** SIMD primitives and vector types are exposed exclusively via the import path `@unworklet/core/simd`. Code that does not import this path never references `Node<'f32x4'>` or any vec primitive.
- **Q3-b (v0.1.0 MVP, phased rollout):** v0.1.0 ships the minimal surface — `Node<'f32x4'>`, `vec4` / `splat` construction, `addVec` / `subVec` / `mulVec` / `divVec`, `lane` access (compile-time-constant index), `loadVec` / `storeVec`. The comprehensive surface (`f64x2`, `i32x4`, mask vectors, `shuffle`, comparisons, gather / scatter) rolls out additively across v0.1.x; rollout order is settled in Q14.
- **Q3-c (parallel families, not generic):** scalar (`Node<'f32'>` etc.) and vector (`Node<'f32x4'>` etc.) primitives are separate functions over separate types. `add` and `addVec` are distinct primitives; mixed scalar / vec operations are type errors and require explicit `splat` / `lane` conversion.

**Rationale:**

- *Opt-in via separate import path*: scalar-only authors never encounter SIMD concepts in IDE completions, type-checker errors, or code reviews. SIMD-using authors get first-class access without compromise. This is the framework's expression of "users who don't need it never see it; users who do need it have it natively" — feature reduction is not a substitute for mental-model unification.
- *Phased rollout*: shipping the minimal MVP first lets v0.1.x extend additively based on observed user demand (which lane widths and operations show up in DSP packages first), instead of guessing the comprehensive surface up front. The MVP covers hand-vectorized 4-lane DSP — the most common SIMD shape — and downstream extensions do not break the v0.1.0 surface.
- *Parallel families over generics*: distinct scalar and vec primitives keep the scalar surface untouched (a `Node<'f32'>`-only reader never has to read `<T>` in a primitive's signature). Function names also signal "this is vectorized" at the call site, easing performance review. Cross-width generics buy little reuse and would leak SIMD existence into scalar-only callers' types.

**Rejected:**

- *No SIMD in v0.1 (scalar-only)* — would tell users with heavy DSP needs (FFT, multi-channel mixers, partitioned convolution) that unworklet is not for them. SIMD coverage is part of the framework's value proposition, not an optional v2 feature. Cutting it for "simpler mental model" conflated mental-model unification with feature reduction.
- *Hidden auto-vectorization (compiler decides silently)* — performance becomes implementation-defined. Users cannot predict whether a hot path is vectorized; small refactors can flip the decision. A silent perf trap is worse than an explicit surface for the users who need control.
- *Single import path with vec primitives mixed in* — would put `f32x4` and `addVec` in the IDE completion of every scalar-only author, contradicting the opt-in principle.
- *Generics across width (`add<T extends 'f32' | 'f32x4'>`)* — would make the same primitive accept scalar or vec, leaking SIMD existence into scalar-only authors' type signatures and IDE tooltips. The reuse benefit is minor; the surface-clarity loss is meaningful.
- *Comprehensive surface in v0.1.0* — premature commitment. f64x2 vs i32x4 vs mask-and-shuffle priorities are best decided after early DSP packages start using the f32x4 MVP.
